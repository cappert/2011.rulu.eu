Through his tireless development and advocacy of the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the concepts of component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails, proving that there should be no such thing as a double-render error, and that one need not be slave to the great monolithic view mentality.

              <p>REST is an architectural style for distributed systems. However, many implementations forget about the distributed part of REST and simply map CRUD operations to HTTP verbs in a monolithic application. Hey, we want more! So let's have a look at the Roar gem and see how it helps working with representations, hypermedia, and decoupled architectures in Rails and Sinatra. While building both services and a consuming client we can discuss the sweet things about component-oriented architectures and french beer.</p>

            <span class="summary">
              <p>Computers are being built with more and more CPUs and those CPUs in turn have several cores. Powerful calculations are now performed either on many-cored machines, or on distributed systems. In this context, it's in the developer's interest to start thinking about concurrent programming. But concurrent programming with mutable is tricky. The last few years have conclusively shown that very few developers get this right when faced with conventional shared state threads.</p>
              <p>One of the ways to simplify concurrent programming is the actor model. In the actor model, programs are made of actors sending each other messages, and acting on the messages they receive. The actors don't share any state.</p>
              <p>In this talk I explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby.</p>
              <p>The existing actor implementations in Ruby:
              <dl>
                <dd>- Rubinius actors</dd>
                <dd>- Existing actor gems (cross Ruby implementations)</dd>
              </dl>
              </p>
              <p>Actor implementations that are a little more 'out there':
              <dl>
                <dd>- Bindings with the Akka framework in Scala with JRuby</dd>
                <dd>- Bindings with erlang, the first mainstream implementation of the actor model</dd>
                <dd>- And their advantages and drawbacks, and code examples.</dd>
              <dl>
              </p>
              <p>The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).</p>

              <p>At least since node.js everyone knows that real time HTTP responses are the next big thing. The secrets of handling incoming requests asynchronously with Ruby is not yet far spread among Rubyists, as the internals needed for such responses are neither specified nor documented and there is a lack of tools. Still, it is possible to use Server-Sent Events,  Websockets and akin with Rack today. This talk will demonstrate the underlying technologies and how to use them.</p>

Being a developer is much more than writing nice code... its about building an experience for your users.

Over millions of years we have been trained to follow certain basic social behaviours and if you understand those behaviours, you can use them to give your users a very positive experience.</p>
              <p>Some of the talk will be scientific, but a lot of it will highlight real usable techniques to get the desired effects. I hope to guide everyone through a lot of examples and analysis of companies where they went right ... and where they failed."</p>

              <p>Joseph Wilk is a member of the core development team for Cucumber. He has been developing for the web for 11 years in both big and small companies and as an entrepreneur. After stints working with Java and Python he finally found Ruby. Since then he has become a regular speaker at various Ruby conferences around the world. He spends his time in-between eating Cucumbers and travelling, working at Songkick.com. Having more fun than is healthy working as a Software Gardener building web systems and working on open source projects. He suffers from test obsession and has given up hope of any treatment.</p>

            <h5 class="side_title">The Limited Red Society</h5>
            <span class="summary">
              <p>During an hour of programming what do you learn about your performance? How did that last refactoring go? How does that hour compare to the previous hour? How about against last week or last month? How are your habits as a programmer improving? How does your refactoring pattern differ from a masters like Martin Fowlers?</p>
              <p>Professional Tennis players learn from detailed statistics about how they performed in a game and use this information to become better players.</p>
              <p>Why don't we do the same in Programming? I want to demonstrate how we can, especially how we as individual programmers can help limit the time we spend in the red (failing tests) while developing. How long we spend in the red and how often can reflect on how we are working as programmers. Joshua Kerievsky created ""The Limited Red Society"", a group of practitioners that have learned how to effectively reduce red time while test-driving and refactoring code. I want to introduce this society to the Ruby world and some of the tools and ideas I have been working on.</p>
              <p>We can gain detailed insight into your programming patterns while using a TDD flow by recording the state of your tests every time you run them. From these detailed metrics we can start to visualise how you work. How long did we spend in the red with that failed test? Was that test we wrote too big a step leaving us stuck in the red for too long? Did we spend a long time in the red because we were shaving a Yak? How many unit tests did we just break with that last change?</p>

            <span class="summary">
              <p>In unreliable networks, with unreliable processors (also known as "The Cloud") one must know all the ways their thing can fail;   And just as importantly, how to recover.  It is even better to have the ability to recover in an automated way.  I'll go over the common failure conditions in distributed systems, and then introduce you to Doozer, the highly-available, consistant data store that makes recovering from these problems easy.</p>
